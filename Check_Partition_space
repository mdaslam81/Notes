✅ Method 1: sys.dm_db_partition_stats + sys.indexes
This shows row and page count per partition.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
    i.name AS index_name,
    p.partition_number,
    SUM(ps.used_page_count) * 8 AS used_space_kb,
    SUM(ps.reserved_page_count) * 8 AS reserved_space_kb,
    SUM(ps.row_count) AS total_rows
FROM sys.dm_db_partition_stats ps
JOIN sys.partitions p
    ON ps.partition_id = p.partition_id
JOIN sys.indexes i
    ON p.object_id = i.object_id AND p.index_id = i.index_id
WHERE i.object_id = OBJECT_ID('dbo.YourTable')  -- replace with your table
  AND i.type = 1 -- clustered index
GROUP BY i.name, p.partition_number
ORDER BY p.partition_number;
✅ Method 2: sp_spaceused (for entire table/index)
sql
Copy
Edit
-- For the whole table
EXEC sp_spaceused 'dbo.YourTable';

-- For a specific index (e.g., clustered)
SELECT 
    OBJECT_NAME(i.object_id) AS TableName,
    i.name AS IndexName,
    i.type_desc,
    SUM(a.used_pages) * 8 AS UsedSpaceKB
FROM sys.indexes i
JOIN sys.partitions p ON i.object_id = p.object_id AND i.index_id = p.index_id
JOIN sys.allocation_units a ON p.partition_id = a.container_id
WHERE i.object_id = OBJECT_ID('dbo.YourTable')
  AND i.type = 1  -- clustered
GROUP BY i.object_id, i.name, i.type_desc;
✅ Method 3: Per Partition — sys.allocation_units + sys.partitions
To get space per partition, include filegroup or partition_number grouping.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
    p.partition_number,
    fg.name AS filegroup_name,
    SUM(a.total_pages) * 8 AS total_kb,
    SUM(a.used_pages) * 8 AS used_kb
FROM sys.partitions p
JOIN sys.allocation_units a ON p.partition_id = a.container_id
JOIN sys.indexes i ON p.object_id = i.object_id AND p.index_id = i.index_id
JOIN sys.filegroups fg ON i.data_space_id = fg.data_space_id
WHERE p.object_id = OBJECT_ID('dbo.YourTable')
  AND i.type = 1 -- clustered index
GROUP BY p.partition_number, fg.name
ORDER BY p.partition_number;

✅ 1. List All Indexes (Clustered & Non-Clustered) on a Table
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
    i.name AS index_name,
    i.type_desc AS index_type,
    i.index_id,
    i.data_space_id,
    ps.name AS partition_scheme,
    pf.name AS partition_function
FROM sys.indexes i
LEFT JOIN sys.data_spaces ds ON i.data_space_id = ds.data_space_id
LEFT JOIN sys.partition_schemes ps ON ds.data_space_id = ps.data_space_id
LEFT JOIN sys.partition_functions pf ON ps.function_id = pf.function_id
WHERE i.object_id = OBJECT_ID('dbo.YourTable');  -- Replace with your table name
✅ 2. See Partition-Level Info for Each Index
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
    i.name AS index_name,
    i.type_desc AS index_type,
    p.partition_number,
    p.rows,
    au.total_pages * 8 AS total_kb,
    au.used_pages * 8 AS used_kb
FROM sys.indexes i
JOIN sys.partitions p ON i.object_id = p.object_id AND i.index_id = p.index_id
JOIN sys.allocation_units au ON p.partition_id = au.container_id
WHERE i.object_id = OBJECT_ID('dbo.YourTable')  -- Replace as needed
ORDER BY i.index_id, p.partition_number;
This shows:

Partition numbers

Row count

Space used per index and partition

✅ 3. List Index Type and Whether It's Partitioned
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
    i.name AS index_name,
    i.type_desc AS index_type,
    ds.name AS data_space_name,
    CASE 
        WHEN ps.name IS NOT NULL THEN 'Yes'
        ELSE 'No'
    END AS is_partitioned
FROM sys.indexes i
JOIN sys.objects o ON i.object_id = o.object_id
JOIN sys.data_spaces ds ON i.data_space_id = ds.data_space_id
LEFT JOIN sys.partition_schemes ps ON ds.data_space_id = ps.data_space_id
WHERE o.name = 'YourTable'  -- Replace with your table
  AND o.type = 'U';  -- user table
